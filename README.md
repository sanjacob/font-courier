# IBM Courier

A fork of dse/font-og-courier which only includes the files you need,
with a painstaking name change since @dse decided to name his font `Gourier`
rather than **Courier**.

Only the TrueType fonts are included since some software is incompatible with
PostScript Type 1 OpenType (.otf), which are the ones also included in the upstream.

Feel free to rename and add those variants which I have not added (.woff, etc.)
